FootLens – Player Injury Impact Dashboard

FootLens is a data-driven dashboard designed to analyse how football players’ injuries influence their performance levels and, indirectly, their team’s results. The purpose of this project is to take real match and injury information, clean it, organise it and convert it into meaningful insights that coaches, analysts and decision-makers can easily interpret. The dataset used for the analysis contains player names, team names, ages, injury dates, return dates, ratings for three matches before the injury and three matches after, and additional contextual information such as opposition teams and seasons. Before building the dashboard, the dataset required extensive cleaning. Invalid values such as “N.A.” and blank cells were converted into proper missing values, dates were standardised, and numerical fields like ratings and age were transformed into usable formats. After cleaning, I created new columns to capture key analytical indicators, including the average rating before the injury, the average rating after the injury, the performance drop between the two phases and the month in which the injury occurred.

Once the data was prepared, I organised the dashboard around five core visualisations. The first is a bar chart that highlights the top players who experienced the biggest reduction in performance after their injury. This visual is useful for immediately spotting players whose injuries had the strongest negative impact. The second visual, a before-and-after rating timeline, shows how player performance trends shift around the injury date. When no player is selected, the timeline displays trends for all players together, allowing for comparison between individuals; when a specific player is chosen, only that player’s rating history is shown. The third visual is a heatmap illustrating the frequency of injuries across different months for each club, which helps identify periods in the season when injuries are more common. The fourth visualisation is a scatter plot comparing player age against their performance drop, offering insight into whether older players are more likely to experience a noticeable decline after returning from injury. The final visual is a comeback leaderboard that ranks players by how much they improved after their return, highlighting those who performed better than before.

To make the dashboard interactive, I added sidebar filters that allow users to focus on specific teams, individual players or custom date ranges. These filters automatically update the visuals, giving users full control over how they explore the data. An option to download the filtered dataset is also included, which allows users to continue their analysis outside the dashboard if required. Key metrics, such as the number of filtered records, the average drop across the selection and the aggregate before-and-after rating comparison, are displayed at the top of the dashboard to give a quick overview of the current view.

Running the project is straightforward. After cloning the repository, installing the required dependencies through the requirements file and launching Streamlit, the dashboard opens in a browser window and is immediately ready to use. The entire project demonstrates essential data-science skills such as data cleaning, numerical processing, exploratory analysis and the creation of interactive visual tools. As part of the Maths for AI summative assessment, FootLens shows how mathematical thinking and data analysis can be applied to real-world sports scenarios and how raw information can be turned into insights that offer value to teams, coaches and stakeholders.
